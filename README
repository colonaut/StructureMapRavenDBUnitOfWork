      This adds a unit of work for the RavenDB Client to the StructureMap.MVC4 DependencyResolution which lets you implement an instance of IDocumentSession envoked by structuremap in any controller.
      The approach of triggering a RavenDB UnitOfWork is an overworked implementation of approach of Arnold Zokas, which is designed for an Integration of RavenDB w/o having to derive the Mvc Controller.
      You can use it with or without the StructureMap.MVC4 Controllerfactory.
      For your convenience, the filter which closes the RavenDB DocumentSession is registered global by default.
      If you do not want to register the attribute for every controller, disable the global registration within StructuremapMvcRavenDbUnitOfWork.cs in App_Start and register the Attribute manually only for those
      controllers which get an IDocumentSession injected.

      This implementation is built on StructureMap.MVC4 (Web Advanced)
